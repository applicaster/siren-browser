# Siren Browser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/applicaster/siren-broswer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/applicaster/siren-broswer) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/applicaster/siren-broswer.svg)](https://david-dm.org/applicaster/siren-broswer)

Siren API Browser client for the web.


## Goal
To have a production ready [Siren API](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren) Browser that is fully tested and supports all Siren API features.


## Live demo

[http://applicaster.github.io/siren-broswer/](http://applicaster.github.io/siren-broswer/)

## Why build a new one?

This work is based to some extent on both - https://github.com/wurlinc/siren-browser, and https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren-api-browser Siren browsers.

* https://github.com/wurlinc/siren-browser - [isn't actively supported](https://github.com/wurlinc/siren-browser/issues/4).
* https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren-api-browser - Our browser is heavily inspired on @kevinswiber's work in terms of UI and some of the logics. Once we feel it's stable enough we'll create a pull request and hope it can be treated as the 2.0 fork of @kevinswiber's implementation. Our browser has all the functionality of @kevinswiber's browser + test coverege and support for sub-entities actions inline.
